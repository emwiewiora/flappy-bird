# flappy-bird

This is a JS tutorial by Ania Kubow for FCC. The tutorial was about the mechanics and not the styling.

I will get back to the styling later. the second half of the tutorial is a flappy birds game.

update: Styling is mostly done. adding extra features.  Yes the top bar needs new coloring.

Things I changed:<br>
Added a random gap feature.<br>
Added a moving cloud sprite to add depth to the game.<br>
Game speed gets faster the longer you play. "levels"<br>
Added a slight variable column generation<br>
set body to "overflow-y: hidden;" to avoid page scrolling.<br>
set ".game-container" to "overflow: hidden;" and removed the left and right border panels.<br>
Re-layout the game so it is centered on the window horizontally .<br>
