# flappy-bird

This is a JS tutorial by Ania Kubow for FCC. The tutorial was about the mechanics and not the styling.

I will get back to the styling later. the second half of the tutorial is a flappy birds game.

Things I changed:
Added a random gap feature.
Added a moving cloud sprite to add depth to the game.
Game speed gets faster the longer you play. "levels"
Added a slight variable column generation
set body to "overflow-y: hidden;" to avoid page scrolling.
set ".game-container" to "overflow: hidden;" and removed the left and right border panels.
Re-layout the game so it is centered on the window horizontally .
